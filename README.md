## Introduction

This is just a repository for some of my projects while I'm trying to learn python and some old pascal projects.  
There is no groundbreaking code, it's all just beginner stuff so don't bother too much.

### F1_USGP.pas

This is a project I made in pascal that allows the user to get the race results for their desired racer by entering their number.  
For now the database was manually added but my goal is to make it so it updates every race, and doing a rewrite in python.  
Maybe if creating a program for each driver is easier and then making one with all of them that gathers the data from the other stuff but I don't know if that is possible or not. Perhaps it should be my summer project haha. Such a basic thing...
You can run it by dowloading the code, compiling it with fpc and then exeuting it. Have fun!
